Topic: The Role of Social Media in Modern Communication

Social media has fundamentally transformed how we communicate in the 21st century.
Platforms like Twitter, Instagram, and TikTok have created new forms of expression
that prioritize brevity and visual content over long-form writing.

However, this shift comes with significant drawbacks. The constant need for
engagement encourages superficial interactions rather than deep conversations.
Studies show that heavy social media users often experience increased anxiety
and decreased attention spans.

Despite these concerns, social media also democratizes information sharing.
Marginalized voices can now reach global audiences without traditional gatekeepers.
The Arab Spring and #MeToo movement demonstrate how these platforms enable
social change.

In conclusion, while social media has revolutionized communication, we must
critically examine its impact on discourse quality and mental health.
